# Artificial-Neural-Networks

 This Repository is about basic structure of Artificial neural networks and their implementation. 

# 1 Logistic regression

The logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.
So in this project i have used simple logistic regression classifier to recognize cats.

# 2 Planar Data classification

In this notebook we will generate red and blue points to form a flower. we will then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points. we will try different layers and see the results.

# Deep neural network

     * In this notebook, we will implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
     * In the next assignment, we will use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.
